**About using the I2C bus:**
- the maximum allowable bus capacitance is 400 pF, the bus length does NOT matter.
- it is not allowed to use devices with the same addresses.
- the maximum number of devices on the I2C bus is no more than 128 pcs. Addresses from 0 to 127, one for "master" and others for "slave". Excluding reserved addresses ([1](https://github.com/TrDA-hab/Projects/blob/master/I2C%20bus/README.md#1)).
- ready-made I2C modules, already have pull-up resistors, and you should not worry.
- what type of pull-up resistors should we choose for "handmade" device? It depends on many factors, but to be on the safe side anything between 2 k立 and 16 k立 (optimal 4.7 k立 and 10 k立.). The more devices are connected to the I2C bus the smaller has to be the resistor(!).
- if you need a "longer" I2C bus, you must use a repeater ([2](https://github.com/TrDA-hab/Projects/blob/master/I2C%20bus/README.md#2)).  
- if you need more devices with the same address, you must use a multiplexer ([3](https://github.com/TrDA-hab/Projects/blob/master/I2C%20bus/README.md#3)).  
- if it is necessary to logically match the levels, you must use alevel translator ([4](https://github.com/TrDA-hab/Projects/blob/master/I2C%20bus/README.md#4)).
- if you need to connect several sensors, you must use I2C extender ([5](https://github.com/TrDA-hab/Projects/blob/master/I2C%20bus/README.md#5)).
- I2C bus allows connecting ([hot-swappable](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/scpa058/scpa058.pdf)) modules.
- for the I2C bus, you can use the ([Rx and Tx](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-Basic-and-BME280/#connect-bme280-to-sonoff-basic-based-on-the-gpio-locations)) of your ESP8266.  

## 1. 
**Reserved I2C addresses:**  
- 0x00 - Reserved - General Call Address.  
- 0x01 - Reserved for CBUS Compatibility.  
- 0x02 - Reserved for I2C-compatible Bus Variants.  
- 0x03 - Reserved for Future Use.  
- 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07 - Reserved for Hs-mode Master.  
- 0x78, 0x79, 0x7A, 0x7B - Reserved for 10-bit I2C Addressing.  
- 0x7C, 0x7D, 0x7E, 0x7F - Reserved for Future Purposes.  

## 2. 
**If it is necessary to "increase the capacity" of the I2C bus, then it is necessary to use - the PCA9515A repeater:**
- no software support required (!).

## 3. 
**If it is necessary to bypass the same addresses on the I2C bus, then it is necessary to use - TCA9548A multiplexer:**
- software support required (!!!), now (02/01/2021) is not supported in Tasmota.
